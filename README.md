# FiveInArow
This is a five_in_a_row project with ai(kuon) .</br>

The ai include kuon(くおん) and hitagi()ひたぎ:</br>
Each ai is compiled into dll individually .</br>

kuon:</br>
 くおん can solve the problem by gametree and α-β pruning.</br>
 くおん can be stochastic in some way.</br>
 くおん is compiled by c.</br>

hitagi:</br>
	The project is compiled on entire c with extern dependence fann.</br>
	ひたぎ is based on ann network and reinformance learning(bp-td).</br>
	ひたぎ can be trained to be more intelligent.</br>
	ひたぎ can evaluate the chessboard in a dynamic way depends on trainning.</br>
	ひたぎ involved クオンsuch as gametree and α-β pruning.
